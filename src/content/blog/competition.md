# Do you want to be succesful or do you want to make an impact?

This question by Jimoh Boyi resonated deeply and set the stage for what later became the theme of Project GENIUS: **"Local solutions to local problems."** The idea was to promote practical problem-solving while utilizing readily available resources.

This project has been the most challenging endeavor I've embarked on. Starting out, I had zero experience in project management and hadn't ever heard of the term until I met **ISA-BELLO AWWAL**. I struggled with selecting team members, identifying stakeholders, and most significantly, fundraising.

Regardless of all the setbacks, I was determined to see it through to the end, no matter the obstacles I faced along the way. I had a lot of first experiences, met amazing people, and learned a lot along the way.

The maiden edition of Project GENIUS was a success. The primary goal was to encourage the practical implementation of engineering principles to solve problems and bridge the gap between theoretical classroom knowledge and real-world experience.

The contest spanned a duration of 6 months. During this period, a total of **52 teams**, comprising **178 participants**, registered for the competition. On the **8th of June**, I moderated a webinar where **ISA-BELLO AWWAL**, the keynote speaker, provided the contestants with comprehensive insights into the fields of Engineering, Innovation, and Project Management.

The first round of the contest required teams to submit a video pitch, a detailed proposal, and a cost-benefit analysis report. On the **8th of July**, four teams were selected. I gave each team seed funding covering **50%** of their prototype costs.

The final round took place at the PG e-library in **Kashim Ibrahim Library** on the **15th of August** and was attended by **271 attendees**. The event was hosted by **Arome Bakwo**. **Al-Ihsan Muhammad** gave the foreword, and the contestants proceeded to present their prototypes to the panel of judges consisting of: **@Dr.S.M Yusuf, Engr. Jacob, Engr. Bashir**, and **ISA-BELLO AWWAL**.

While the results were being compiled, **Innocent Bayila, Solomon Hamza Abdul Hafeez**, and I delivered insightful presentations to the attendees.

In addition to the finalists, **team Farmlink** showcased their software and secured sponsorship.

I am incredibly pleased with the outcome of the first edition of the Project GENIUS contest. The level of participation and the quality of the projects submitted far exceeded our expectations. I am profusely grateful to **Ezra Azi** and **Alamin Ahmad Gani**, who supported me financially, and to all who encouraged me to pull this off: **Abdulkarim Bobboi, Muhammad Salman, Abbad Islam, Abdulazeez - Folaranmi Bello, Fatima Balarabe, Mubarak H., Binshi Musa-Bently, Abubakar Sadiq Bilyamin, Mr. Owolabi Ayodeji Prince, Mr. Benjamin, Muhammed Bashir Muazu, Muhammad Mukhtar Bardi, Laila Taoffick, Sabur Alim**.

**Watch out for edition 2.0 ðŸ’¥**
